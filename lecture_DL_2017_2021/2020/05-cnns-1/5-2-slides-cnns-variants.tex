    \only<2>{\item That is 8 for the first location.}
    \only<2>{\item Due to the filter of size 2 we have the dimensions of the original feature map and obtain downsampling.}

    \only<3>{\item Max pooling brings us 2 properties: 1) dimention reduction and 2) spatial invariance.}
    \item Popular pooling functions: max and (weighted) average.}
    %\only<4>{\item Blurring the image by randomly changing pixel entries by either +1 or -1 will only marginally change activations.}

    \only<1>{\item Similar to max pooling, we downsample the feature map but optimally lose no information.}

Every value in the bottom row has changed, but only half of the values in the top row have changed, because the max pooling units are sensitive only to the maximum value in the neighborhood, not its exact location (Goodfellow, \emph{et al.}, 2016, ch.~9).}}

\frametitle{Input Channel}

\begin{vbframe}{Input Channel}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item An image consists of the smallest indivisible segments called pixels and every pixel has a strength often known as the pixel intensity. Whenever we study a digital image, it usually comes with three color channels, i.e. the Red-Green-Blue channels, popularly known as the RGB values. 
       \item In colored images, each pixel can be represented by a vector of three numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) for the three primary color channels: red, green, and blue.
       \item A grayscale image has a single input channel and value of each pixel represents only an amount of light; 
       \item Note a grayscale value can lie between 0 to 255, 0 signifies black and 255 signifies white. 
    \end{itemize}

  \end{figure}

In this CNN:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item there are 3 input channel, with the size of 4x4 as an input matrices, 
       \item one 2x2 filter (also known as kernel), 
       \item a single ReLu layer,
       \item a single pooling layer (which applies the MaxPool function),
       \item and a single fully connected (FC) layer.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
       \item The elements of the filter matrix are equivalent to the unit weights in a standard NN and will be updated during the backpropagation phase.
       \item Assuming a stride of 2 with no padding, the size of the convolution layer is determined by the following equation:
       \item $ O = \frac{I - K + 2.P}{S} + 1$ where: 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item O: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the new(convolution) square matrix, 
       \item I: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the input square matrix,
       \item K: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the filter (kernel) square matrix, 
       \item P: is the number of pixels(cells) of padding added,
       \item S: is the stride, or the number of cells skipped each time the kernel is slided.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

 \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{plots/05_conv_variations/channels/cnn-net.png}
  \end{figure}

Putting these values in the equation,

\begin{align} 
O&={(4 - 2 + 2.0)\over 2} + 1\\ 
&=2 
\end{align}
