The ```strides``` parameter specifies the *movement* of the kernel on the original image: in this case each convolution will *skip* one pixel at a time. The ```padding``` parameter keeps the output size of the features ```SAME``` as the input.\n\nThe pooling layers will be created using the ```max_pool(...)``` method. Each of our pooling layers has a 2x2 kernel and will skip---the ```strides``` parameter---2 rows and 2 columns at a time. The ```padding``` parameter here will apply padding if any downsampling results in a fractional number of pixels.\n\nEvery neuron (apart from those in the input layer) is connected to its predecessors via a number of links, each with a specific weight attached to it. The code below initializes the weights to a random number drawn from a ```truncated_normal``` distribution with standard deviation of 0.1. The ```shape``` parameter is used by the method's logic to determine how many weights to create.\n\nJust like the weights, each neuron has some *tuneable* bias. The ```bias_variable(...)``` method initializes the biases for the neurons to a ```constant``` equal to 0.1; these biases change as we train the network."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Convolution and Pooling\ndef conv2d(x, W):\n  \"\"\"conv2d returns a 2d convolution layer with full stride.\"\"\"\n  return tf.nn.conv2d(x, W, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')\n\n\ndef max_pool_2x2(x):\n  \"\"\"max_pool_2x2 downsamples a feature map by 2X.\"\"\"\n  return tf.nn.max_pool(x, ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1],\n                        strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME')\n\n# Weight Initialization\ndef weight_variable(shape):\n  \"\"\"weight_variable generates a weight variable of a given shape.\"\"\"\n  initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1)\n  return tf.Variable(initial)\n\n\ndef bias_variable(shape):\n  \"\"\"bias_variable generates a bias variable of a given shape.\"\"\"\n  initial = tf.constant(0.1, shape=shape)\n  return tf.Variable(initial)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Create the model\n\nThe ```deepnn(...)``` method builds the artificial neural network we will use to classify the digits. \n\nHere's the overview of the structure of the network we will use:\n\n![](http://tomdrabas.com/data/PyData/ConvStructure_NoTanh.png)\n\n1. The input layer is a grey scale image of 28x28 pixels. This is accomplished with the ```tf.reshape(...)``` method. The first parameter to the function is the *tensor* we want to reshape, and the other one specifies the desired shape of the output.\n2. Convolution layer 1 maps one grayscale image to 32 feature maps using 5x5 kernels using ReLU (rectifier) activation function\n3. Pooling layer 1 down samples image by 2x so you have a 14x14 matrix \n4. Convolution layer 2 maps 32 feature maps to 64 using ReLU (rectifier) activation function\n5. Pooling layer 2  down samples by 2x with 64 images of 7x7 (vs. 14x14)\n6. The fully connected feed-forward part maps the 64 features of 7x7 pixels to an array of 1024 neurons that then get passed throught the ```argmax(...)``` method to come up with an actual output with one activated neuron.
