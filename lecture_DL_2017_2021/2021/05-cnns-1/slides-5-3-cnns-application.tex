    %\only<1>{\item Schematic architecture of a CNN}
    \only<1>{\item Suppose we have the following input tensor with dimensions $10 \times 10 \times 3$.}
    \only<2>{\item We use a filter of size $2$.}
    \only<3>{\item Applying it to the first spatial location, yields one scalar value.}
    \only<4>{\item The second spatial location yields another one..}
    \only<5>{\item ...and another one...}
    \only<6>{\item ...and another one...}
    \only<7>{\item Finally we obtain an output which is called feature map.}
    \only<8>{\item We initialize another filter to obtain a second feature map.}
    \only<9>{\item All feature maps yield us a \enquote{new image} with dim $h \times w \times N$.}
    \only<10>{\item We actually append them to a new tensor with depth = \# filters.}
    \only<11>{\item All feature map entries will then be activated (e.g. via ReLU), just like the neurons of a standard feedforward net.}
    \only<12>{\item One may use pooling operations to downsample the dimensions of the feature maps.}
    \only<12>{\item Pooling is applied on each feature map independently: the latter, blue block is the pooled version of the previous, blue feature map.}
    \only<13>{\item Many of these layers can be placed successively, to extract even more complex features.}
    \only<13>{\item The feature maps are fed into each other sequentially. For instance, each filter from the second conv layer gets all previous feature maps from the first conv layer as an input. Each filter from the first layer extracts information from the input image tensor.}
    \only<13>{\item The feature maps of the final conv layer are flattened (into a vector) and fed into a dense layer which, in turn, is followed by more dense layers and finally, the output layer.}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item One of use case for CNNs is image classification.
        \item There exist a broad variety of battle-proven image classification architecture such as the AlexNet , the Inception Net or the ResNet which will be discussed in detail in the next lecture.
        \item All those architectures rely on a set of subsequent convolutional filters and aim to learn the mapping from an image to a probability score over a set of classes.

            \item Force it to make a prediction on the colour-value \textbf{for each pixel} in the grayscale input image.
            \item Combine the grayscale-input with the colour-output to yield a colorized image.
