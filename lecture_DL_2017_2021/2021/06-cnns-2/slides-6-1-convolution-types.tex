\begin{vbframe}{Advantages of 1D Convolutions}
A few advantages of $1 \times 1$ convolutions are:
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Dimensionality reduction for efficient computations
     \item Efficient low dimensional embedding, or feature pooling     
     \item Applying nonlinearity again after convolution
     \end{itemize}
The first two advantages can be observed in the previous examples. After 1 $\times$ 1 convolution, we significantly reduce the dimension depth-wise. Say if the original input has 200 channels, the 1  $\times$ 1 convolution will embed these channels (features) into a single channel. 

The third advantage comes in as after the 1  $\times$ 1 convolution, non-linear activation such as ReLU can be added. The non-linearity allows the network to learn more complex function.

\section{2D Convolutions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{vbframe}{2D Convolutions}

The basic idea behind a 2D convolution is sliding a small window (called a "kernel/filter") over a larger 2D array, and performing a dot product between the filter elements and the corresponding input array elements at every position.
    \begin{figure}
        \centering

W is the filter, and the yellow-ish array on the right is the result; the red square shows which element in the result array is being computed.\href{https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/depthwise-separable-convolutions-for-machine-learning/}{here}.}

\textbf{Data situation}: 3-dimensional tensor data.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data consists of tensors with shape [depth, xdim, ydim, zdim].
        \item Dimensions can be both temporal (e.g. video frames) or spatial (e.g. MRI)
        \item Examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Human activity recognition in video data
            \item Disease classification or tumor segmentation on MRI scans
        \end{itemize}

\section{Dilated Convolutions}

\begin{vbframe}{Dilated convolutions}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Idea : artificially increase the receptive field of the net without using more filter weights.
        \item The \textbf{receptive field} of a single neuron comprises all inputs that have an impact on this neuron. 
        \item Neurons in the first layers capture less information of the input, while neurons in the last layers have huge receptive fields and can capture a lot more global information from the input. 
        \item The size of the receptive fields depends on the filter size. 
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace*{-0.5cm}

    \end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
        \item Intuitively, neurons in the first layers capture less information of the input (layer), while neurons in the last layers have huge receptive fields and can capture a lot more global information from the input (layer). 
        \item The size of the receptive fields depends on the filter size.

    \end{figure}

\framebreak 

\begin{itemize}
        \item By increasing the filter size, the size of the receptive fields increases as well and more contextual information can be captured.
        \item However, increasing the filter size increases the number of parameters, which leads to increased runtime. 
        \item Artificially increase the receptive field of the net without using more filter weights by adding a new dilation parameter to the kernel that skips pixels during convolution.
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Capture more contextual information. 
            \item Enable the processing of inputs in higher dimensions to detect fine details. 
            \item Improved run-time-performance due to less parameters.

            \item Generation of audio-signals and songs within the famous Wavenet developed by DeepMind.
            \item Time series classification and forecasting.

\section{Transposed Convolutions}


\begin{vbframe}{Transposed convolutions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Problem setting: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For many applications and in many network architectures, we often want to do transformations going in the opposite direction of a normal convolution, i.e. we would like to perform up-sampling.
            \item examples include generating high-resolution images and mapping low dimensional feature map to high dimensional space such as in auto-encoder or semantic segmentation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Instead of decreasing dimensionality as with regular convolutions, \textbf{transposed convolutions} are used to re-increase dimensionality back to the initial dimensionality.
        %\item Idea: use transposed convolutions to re-increase dimensionality instead of decreasing it as with regular convolutions.
        \item Note: Do not confuse this with deconvolutions (which are mathematically defined as the inverse of a convolution).
    \end{itemize}
    
\framebreak

\section{Separable Convolutions}

 \begin{vbframe}{Separable convolutions}
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Separable Convolutions are used in some neural net architectures, such as the MobileNet.
         \item Motivation: make convolution computationally more efficient.
         \item One can perform:
               \begin{itemize}
                   \item spatially separable convolution 
                   \item depthwise separable convolution.
                \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
      \textbf{spatially separable convolution}: The spatially separable convolution operates on the 2D spatial dimensions of images, i.e. height and width. Conceptually, spatially separable convolution decomposes a convolution into two separate operations.
      \begin{itemize}   
         \item Consider the sobel kernel from the previous lecture:
             \begin{equation*}
                     G_x = 
                     \begin{bmatrix}
                         +1 & 0 & -1 \\
                         +2 & 0 & -2 \\
                         +1 & 0 & -1 
                     \end{bmatrix}
             \end{equation*}
         \item this 3x3 dimensional kernel can be replaced by the outer product of two 3x1 and 1x3 dimensional kernels:
            \begin{equation*}
                     \begin{bmatrix}
                         +1 \\ 
                         +2 \\
                         +1   
                     \end{bmatrix}* 
                     \begin{bmatrix}
                         +1 & 0 & -1   
                     \end{bmatrix}
             \end{equation*}
         \item Convolving with both filters subsequently has a similar effect, reduces the amount of parameters to be stored and thus improves speed:
              \begin{figure}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=6cm]{plots/05_conv_variations/separable/seprablematrix.png}
         \caption{In convolution, the 3x3 kernel directly convolves with the image. In spatially separable convolution, the 3x1 kernel first convolves with the image. Then the 1x3 kernel is applied. This would require 6 instead of 9 parameters while doing the same operations.}
     \end{figure}
     \end{itemize}
 \end{vbframe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{vbframe}{Spatially separable convolution}
  
  Example 1: A convolution on a $5 \times 5$ image with a $3 \times 3$ kernel (stride=1, padding=0) requires scanning the kernel at 3 positions horizontally and 3 vertically. That is 9 positions in total, indicated as the dots in the image below. At each position, 9 element-wise multiplications are applied. Overall, that is 9 x 9 = 81 multiplications.
     \begin{figure}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=4cm]{plots/05_conv_variations/separable/sep0.png}
         \caption{Standard convolution with 1 channel.}
     \end{figure}
   
     \begin{figure}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=8cm]{plots/05_conv_variations/separable/sep1.png}
         \caption{Spatially separable convolution with 1 channel. Overall, the spatially separable convolution takes 45 + 27 = 72 multiplications. (Image source: Bai (2019))}
     \end{figure}
     
    

   \textbf{Note:} However, despite their advantages, spatial separable convolutions are seldom applied in deep learning. This is mainly due to not all kernels being able to get divided into two smaller ones. Replacing all standard convolutions by spatial separable would also introduce a limit in searching for all possible kernels in the training process, implying worse training results.
   
\end{vbframe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{vbframe}{Depthwise separable convolution}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item The depthwise separable convolutions, which is much more commonly used in deep learning (e.g. in MobileNet and Xception).
     \item This convolution separates convolutional process into two stages of depthwise and pointwise.
   \end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{plots/05_conv_variations/separable/example-depthwise2.png}
\caption{Comparision of number of multiplications in Depthwise separable cnn and standard cnn}
\end{figure}
     
Therefore, fewer computations leads faster network.

\end{vbframe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{vbframe}{Depthwise convolution }
 
 As the name suggests, we perform kernel on depth of the input volume (on the input channels). The steps followed in this convolution are:

   \begin{itemize}
     \item Take number of kernels equal to the number of input channels, each kernel having depth 1. Example, if we have a kernel of size $3\times 3$ and an input of size $6\times 6$ with 16 channels, then there will be $16 \times 3 \times 3$ kernels.
     \item Every channel thus has 1 kernel associated with it. This kernel is convolved over the associated channel separately resulting in 16 feature maps.
     \item Stack all these feature maps to get the output volume with $4 \times 4$ output size and 16 channels.
   \end{itemize}

     
\end{vbframe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{vbframe}{Pointwise convolution }
 
As the name suggests, this type of convolution is applied to every single point in the convolution separately (remember $1\times 1$ convs?). So how does this work?

   \begin{itemize}
     \item Take a $1\times 1$ conv with number of filters equal to number of channels you want as output.
     \item Perform basic convolution applied in $1\times 1$ conv to the output of the Depth-wise convolution.
   \end{itemize}

     
\end{vbframe}

\section{Flattened Convolutions}

\begin{vbframe}{Flattened Convolution}
    
Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector. And it is connected to the final classification model, which is called a fully-connected layer.
