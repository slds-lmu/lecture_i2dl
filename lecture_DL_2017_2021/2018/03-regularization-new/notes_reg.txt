please use proper macros for (regularized) risk ect. 
we have riskt and risket. and introduce some macros for J as well

weight decay should have an animation, where we show how gradient steps get "contracted" in each iteration.


weight decay example plot, use 10^-k notation for plot too

tau cannot be used as iteration number for early stopping, maybe use T_stop

early stopping: "eps" is not explained

adversarial examples: image witg plot (46/59). multiple stuff here is not readable. change layout. also never have these small axis labellings!!
it also simply says "credit goodfellow"? below the exmample?

FGSM: we should put a "hat" on theta there, or on "f". this is already fitted.
we also need to be careful with notation here!
the symbolic params we use as argument of the the function should be distinguished from what we input to the function! 
notation: grad_x L(\fhat(x), y). then should also change the notation below the next images.

adversiarial examples:
remove the itemize below the images with a single bullet point

general: 
- im many places you are missing a space before "("
- in many places it just says "credit" below some images. dont know if that is wanted / Ok.
- really check all axis labellings / legends. in MANY places they are absolutely not readable as they are so small
