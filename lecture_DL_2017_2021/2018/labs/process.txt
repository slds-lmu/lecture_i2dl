# General Process/Plan for the Labs for the DL lecture

- We have 2 hours a week from 12 - 14 in the CIP-Pool
- Students will work at this time while Janek (and maybe a HiWi) is present for questions
- More focus on Programming / applying NNs
- They don't have to do anything at home
- We still provide solution material online
- Solutions will be provided in R
- We use Keras instead of mxnet (https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/keras.pdf !!!)

# Exercises


- We take these as solutions and create exercises around them: https://github.com/ja-thomas/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks
- For RL we take Xudongs package
- For HPO we can take some material from the tutorial at WhyR



ToDos:

- Look for more stuff that can be used as exercise
- Distribute intro blocks according to lecture material
- Extend (some) of the exercises with Kaggle challenges
