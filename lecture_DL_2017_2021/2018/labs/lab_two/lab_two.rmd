## Exercise 1 : Regression

Welcome to Lab 2. In this section, we'll work on a "regression" task, which consists of predicting a continuous value instead of a discrete label. For instance, predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data, or predicting the time that a software project will take to complete, given its specifications.

### The Boston Housing Price dataset

We will be attempting to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc.

The dataset we will be using has another interesting difference from our two previous exercises: it has very few data points, only 506 in total, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples, and each "feature" in the input data (e.g. the crime rate is a feature) has a different scale. For instance some values are proportions, which take values between 0 and 1, others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100...

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r}
# Load the data
library(keras)

dataset = dataset_boston_housing()
train_data = dataset$train$x
train_labels = dataset$train$y
test_data = dataset$test$x
test_labels = dataset$test$y
```

```{r}
str(train_data)
```

```{r}
str(test_data)
```


As you can see, we have 404 training samples and 102 test samples. The data comprises 13 features. The 13 features in the input data are as follow:  

1. Per capita crime rate.  
2. Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.  
3. Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.  
4. Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).  
5. Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).  
6. Average number of rooms per dwelling.  
7. Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.  
8. Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.  
9. Index of accessibility to radial highways.  
10. Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.  
11. Pupil-teacher ratio by town.  
12. 1000 * (Bk - 0.63) ** 2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town.  
13. % lower status of the population.  


The targets are the median values of owner-occupied homes, in thousands of dollars:  
```{r}
str(train_targets)
```

The prices are typically between $10,000 and $50,000. If that sounds cheap, remember this was the mid-1970s, and these prices are not inflation-adjusted.

### Preparing the data

It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), you subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature is centered around 0 and has a unit standard deviation. 

```{r}
# Normalize train_data and test_data
# This is easily done in R by first computing the means and standard deviations for the features in the TRAINING data using apply() and then using the scale() function.
# Note that the quantities that we use for normalizing the test data have to be computed using the training data. We should never use in our workflow any quantity computed on the test data, even for something as simple as data normalization.



# TODO


```

### Building our network

Because so few samples are available, we will be using a very small network with two hidden layers, each with 64 units. In general, the less training data you have, the worse overfitting will be, and using a small network is one way to mitigate overfitting.

```{r}
# Because we will need to instantiate the same model multiple times, we'll use a function to construct it.
# Write a fuction build_model that returns a compiled model with the following architecture:
# First layer : Dense with 64 units and ReLU activation. Remember to pass the input_shape as this is the first layer. You only have to specify the number of features (no need to specify the number of training examples).
# Second layer : Again, Dense with 64 units and ReLU activation
# Output layer : Dense with a single unit. Because this is a regression task, there is no activation function.

# Finally, compile the model with RMSProp optimizer, Mean Squared Error loss ("mse") and Mean Absolute Error("mae") metric.
# The metric must be passed as a vector

build_model = function() {

  # TODO
  
}

```


Our network ends with a single unit, and no activation (i.e. it will be linear layer). This is a typical setup for scalar regression (i.e. regression where we are trying to predict a single continuous value). Applying an activation function would constrain the range that the output can take; for instance if we applied a sigmoid activation function to our last layer, the network could only learn to predict values between 0 and 1. Here, because the last layer is purely linear, the network is free to learn to predict values in any range.

Note that we are compiling the network with the `mse` loss function -- Mean Squared Error, the square of the difference between the predictions and the targets, a widely used loss function for regression problems.

We are also monitoring a new metric during training: `mae`. This stands for Mean Absolute Error. It is simply the absolute value of the difference between the predictions and the targets. For instance, a MAE of 0.5 on this problem would mean that our predictions are off by \$500 on average.

### Validating our approach using K-fold validation


To evaluate our network while we keep adjusting its parameters (such as the number of epochs used for training), we could simply split the data into a training set and a validation set, as we were doing in our previous exercises. However, because we have so few data points, the validation set would end up being very small (e.g. about 100 examples). A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot depending on _which_ data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a high _variance_ with regard to the validation split. This would prevent us from reliably evaluating our model.

The best practice in such situations is to use K-fold cross-validation. It consists of splitting the available data into K partitions (typically K=4 or 5), then instantiating K identical models, and training each one on K-1 partitions while evaluating on the remaining partition. The validation score for the model used would then be the average of the K validation scores obtained.

For a (very) quick recap of K-fold CV : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgfjmp-4BA

In terms of code, this is straightforward:

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
#Number of folds
k = 4

#Shuffle the indices and assign them to the k folds
indices = sample(1:nrow(train_data))
folds = cut(indices, breaks = k, labels = FALSE) 

num_epochs = 100

#This will contain the scores for the 4 folds
all_scores = c()

#Write a for loop that, for a given fold:
#1) Prepares the validation and training data using the 'folds' variable above
#2) Builds the Keras model (already compiled) using the build_model() function you defined earlier
#3) Trains the model on the training data (for the particular fold) for num_epochs epochs with a batch size of 1. Do not pass validation data to this function. Pass the argument verbose = 0 to fit() to train in silent mode.
#4) Evaluates the trained model using evaluate() on the validation data (for the particular fold). You need to save the output of evaluate() to a variable.Pass the argument verbose = 0.
#5) Extracts the mean_absolute_error from the variable from step 4 and appends it to all_scores.

for (i in 1:k) {
  
  
  cat("processing fold #", i, "\n")
 
  
  
  
   
  #TODO
  
  
  
  
  
}  

```

```{r}
#Let's look at the scores for the 4 folds
all_scores
```

```{r}
mean(all_scores)
```

As you can notice, the different runs do indeed show rather different validation scores, from about 2.1 to 2.6 (your mileage may vary). Their average (2.37) is a much more reliable metric than any single of these scores -- that's the entire point of K-fold cross-validation. In this case, we are off by \$2,375 on average, which is still significant considering that the prices range from \$10,000 to \$50,000. 

Let's try training the network for a bit longer: 500 epochs. To keep a record of how well the model did at each epoch, we will modify our training loop to save the per-epoch validation score log: 

```{r}
# Some memory clean-up
k_clear_session()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}


num_epochs = 500
all_mae_histories = NULL

#Modify the for loop above to record the per epoch validation score.
#To do this, get rid of the evaluate() function and instead pass the validation data (for a given fold) as an argument (for the parameter validation_data) to fit(). Remember to save the output of fit() to a variable.
#Finally, extract the val_mean_absolute_error from the output of fit() and append these per-epoch validation scores (for a given fold) as a row to all_mae_histories. The function rbind() should come in handy.
#The number of folds and batch size don't change. However, we now train each model for 500 epochs.
#Each fold takes about 3 - 4 minutes. Now would be a good time to grab a coffee.


for (i in 1:k) {
  cat("processing fold #", i, "\n")
  
  #TODO
  
}
```

We can then compute the average of the per-epoch MAE scores for all folds:

```{r}
#Make sure you understand what's happening here.
average_mae_history = data.frame(
  epoch = seq(1:ncol(all_mae_histories)),
  validation_mae = apply(all_mae_histories, 2, mean)
)
```

Let's plot this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(average_mae_history, aes(x = epoch, y = validation_mae)) + geom_line()
```

It may be a bit hard to see the plot due to scaling issues and relatively high variance. Let's use `geom_smooth()` to try to get a clearer picture:

```{r}
ggplot(average_mae_history, aes(x = epoch, y = validation_mae)) + geom_smooth()
```

According to this plot, it seems that validation MAE stops improving significantly after 70 epochs. Past that point, we start overfitting.

Once we are done tuning other parameters of our model (besides the number of epochs, we could also adjust the size of the hidden layers), we can train a final "production" model on all of the training data, with the best parameters, then look at its performance on the test data:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Get a fresh, compiled model.
model = build_model()

# Train it on the entirety of the data.
fit(model, train_data, train_targets,
          epochs = 80, batch_size = 16, verbose = 0)

#Evaluate the model on the test data
result = evaluate(model, test_data, test_targets)
```

```{r}
result
```

We are still off by about \$2,680 (again, your mileage may vary).

## Wrapping up


Here's what you should take away from this exercise:

* Regression is done using different loss functions from classification; Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a commonly used loss function for regression.
* Similarly, evaluation metrics to be used for regression differ from those used for classification; naturally the concept of "accuracy" does not apply for regression. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
* When features in the input data have values in different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently as a preprocessing step.
* When there is little data available, using K-Fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model.
* When little training data is available, it is preferable to use a small network with very few hidden layers (typically only one or two), in order to avoid severe overfitting.

This example concludes our series of three introductory practical examples. You are now able to handle common types of problems with vector data input:

* Binary (2-class) classification.
* Multi-class, single-label classification.
* Scalar regression.


# Exercise 2 : Regularization

In this exercise, we'll look at a couple of different methods to regularize a neural network in order to prevent overfitting.

Recall that the capacity of a neural network is determined by the total number of trainable weights. Neural networks that are very "big" require a correspondingly large amount of training data in order to not overfit. Therefore, if you find that the network overfits, the best solution to the problem is to simply get more training data. 

If this is not possible, you can either:  
1. Reduce the size of the network by removing layers or decreasing the number of neurons in the layers, or,  
2. Regularize the network 

Plotting the validation loss is a simple way to determine whether the network has overfit. During the first few epochs of training, both the training loss and the validation loss tend to decrease in tandem but after a certain point, the validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease. It is at this point that the network begins to overfit.

## Prepare the data

We'll once again be working with the IMDB dataset.Let's prepare the data using code from the previous tutorial.

```{r}
library(keras)

imdb = dataset_imdb(num_words = 10000)
train_data = imdb$train$x
train_labels = imdb$train$y
test_data = imdb$test$x
test_labels = imdb$test$y

vectorize_sequences = function(sequences, dimension = 10000) {
  # Create an all-zero matrix of shape (len(sequences), dimension)
  results = matrix(0, nrow = length(sequences), ncol = dimension)
  for (i in 1:length(sequences))
    # Sets specific indices of results[i] to 1s
    results[i, sequences[[i]]] = 1
  results
}

# Our vectorized training data
x_train = vectorize_sequences(train_data)
# Our vectorized test data
x_test = vectorize_sequences(test_data)

# Our vectorized labels
y_train = as.numeric(train_labels)
y_test = as.numeric(test_labels)
```

## Train multiple networks

In order to get a feel for the overfitting behaviour of neural networks, we'll train 3 different architectures and observe the training and validation losses.

### First model

Our first model is the one we built last time.

```{r}

original_model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 16, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(10000)) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 16, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

compile(original_model, 
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)

```

### Second model

Our second model will be similar to the first but it will be much smaller. 

```{r}

#Reduce the number of neurons in the 2 hidden layers from 16 to 4

smaller_model = keras_model_sequential() %>%
#TODO




#Compile the network using the same settings as the original_model
#TODO




```


### Train both networks

```{r}

#Train the first network using the fit() function for 20 epochs using a batch size of 512
#Remember to pass x_test and y_test as validation data

original_hist = fit(original_model,
#TODO
)



```


```{r}

#Train the second network using the fit() function for 20 epochs using a batch size of 512.
#Once again, remember to pass x_test and y_test as validation data.

smaller_model_hist =  fit(smaller_model,
#TODO
)

```

### Plot the losses

To compare the losses we'll write an R function that takes a named list of loss series and plots it:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
plot_training_losses = function(losses) {
  loss_names = names(losses)
  losses = as.data.frame(losses)
  losses$epoch = seq_len(nrow(losses))
  losses %>% 
    gather(model, loss, loss_names[[1]], loss_names[[2]]) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = epoch, y = loss, colour = model)) +
    geom_point()
}
```

Recall that the object returned by fit() contains both training and validation losses. Plot the validation losses for the two models that we've trained.

```{r}

#Examine the originial_hist and smaller_model_hist objects and feed the validation losses to our helper function.
#Remember to pass a named list containing the two losses



```

As you can see, the smaller network starts overfitting later than the original one and its performance degrades much more slowly once it starts overfitting.

### Third model

Now we'll build a third neural network that is even bigger than the original network. If the previous plot is any indication, this new network should overfit even worse than the original model.

```{r}

#Build a neural network that has the same structure as the original model but increase the number of neurons in the hidden layers from 16 to 512

bigger_model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
#TODO

#Compile the network using the same settings as the original_model
#TODO
```

```{r}

#Train the first network using the fit() function for 20 epochs using a batch size of 512
#Remember to pass x_test and y_test as validation data
bigger_model_hist =  fit(bigger_model,
#TODO
)



```

Here's how the bigger network fares compared to the reference one:

```{r}
#Plot the validation losses for the two models (original and bigger) by feeding the appropropriate variables to our helper function
#TODO

```

The bigger network starts overfitting almost right away, after just one epoch, and overfits much more severely. Its validation loss is also more noisy.

Let's plot the training losses:

```{r}

#Plot the training losses for the two models (original and bigger) by feeding the appropropriate variables to our helper function
#TODO
```


As you can see, the bigger network gets its training loss near zero very quickly. The more capacity the network has, the quicker it will be able to model the training data (resulting in a low training loss), but the more susceptible it is to overfitting (resulting in a large difference between the training and validation loss).

## Adding weight regularization

Recall that weight regularization constrains the learning algorithm by penalizing large weights. This reduces the effective capacity of the network and helps prevent overfitting.

There are two main flavours of weight regularization:

* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _absolute value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the "L1 norm" of the weights).
* L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _square of the value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the "L2 norm" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called _weight decay_ in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.

Regularizing a network in Keras is extremely easy. All you need to do is pass a weight regularizer object as the argument to the kernel_regularizer parameter of a layer. 

Keras has 3 built-in regularizers : regularizer_l1() , regularizer_l2() and regularizer_l1_l2(). For example, regularizer_l1(0.01) creates an L1 regularizer object with a regularization coefficient of 0.01. This means that the penalty term is equal to 0.01 * (sum of absolute values of the weights in the layer).

```{r}

# Build a regularized version of original_model by adding L2 weight regularizers to the two hidden layers
# Choose a regularization coefficient of 0.001 

l2_model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
#TODO


#Compile the model with the same configuration as original_model
#TODO


```

Because the penalty term is only added during training (that is, it is not added when evaluating the model on the test set), the training error of this regularized model will be much higher.

```{r}

# Train the model that you've just built for 20 epochs with a batch size of 512.
# Remember to pass the test set as validation_data

l2_model_hist =  fit(l2_model,
#TODO
)



```

```{r}

#Plot the validation losses of the regularized and unregularized networks.



```


As you can see, the regularized model is less likely to overfit eventhough both models have the same number of parameters.


## Dropout regularization

Dropout is a very popular technique to regularize neural nets. It works by randomly turning off (or "dropping out")  the input/hidden neurons in a network . This means different samples are trained on different subsets of the neurons. 
![](figures/dropout.png)

Note that dropout is only added during training time (the entire network is used to evaluate the model on the test set or to make predictions). At test time, we scale down the output by the dropout rate.

In Keras, dropout is implemented as its own separate layer, layer_dropout. To apply dropout to a layer, place a layer_dropout in front of it while stacking layers.

The probability of a unit being dropped out can be passed as an argument to layer_dropout().

```{r}
#Create a new model by adding dropout to the two hidden layers of original_model
#Use a dropout rate of 0.5
#https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/layer_dropout.html

dpt_model = keras_model_sequential() %>% 
#TODO





#Compile the model with the same configuration as the original model
#TODO

```

```{r}
# Train dpt_model for 20 epochs with a batch size of 512
# Remember to pass in x_test and y_test as validation data

dpt_model_hist =  fit(dpt_model,
#TODO
)
```

```{r}
#Plot the validation losses of dpt_model and original_model
#TODO

```

Once again, we see a marked improvement in the new model.

That's the end of the second tutorial. The take-home message is this : Large neural networks can easily overfit small training sets. This means that the network learns spurious patterns that are present in the training data and, therefore, fails to generalize to unseen examples. In such a scenario, your options are :  
1. Get more training data  
2. Reduce the size of the network  
3. Regularize the network
