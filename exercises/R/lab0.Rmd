## Labs

 - Mix of theoretical and practical exercises
 - Not graded! Only final exam counts
 - Exercises and solutions for the previous week posted on Moodle on Tuesday morning
 - We will discuss the solutions for the previous week.
 - Lab sessions exist to discuss and ask questions
    - Attend not to fall behind the schedule

## Theory-oriented Exercises

 - Apply the math you see in the lectures
    - Pen-and-paper exercises on simple cases
    - Code the solution and test on simple problems
    - Brush up your linear algebra!
 - Purpose:
   1. Understand and internalize how things work
   2. Get practical experience in implementing ML algorithms
   3. Get ready for the exam

## Practice-oriented Exercises

 - Play with neural networks
   - github.com/jjallaire/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks
   - github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
 - Handouts both in in R and Python
   - I will present the solutions in either R or Python depending on the topic, but you are free to use and ask questions about the other version
 - Purpose:
   1. Learn to use a popular Deep Learning Framework
      - For R we will use Keras/Tensorflow
      - For Python we will use PyTorch
   2. Get a feeling for how neural networks behave
