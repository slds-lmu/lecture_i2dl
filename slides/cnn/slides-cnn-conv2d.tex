\begin{vbframe}{Filters to extract features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Filters are widely applied in Computer Vision (CV) since the 70's.
        \item One prominent example: \textbf{Sobel-Filter}.
        \item Detects edges in images.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Edges occur where the intensity over neighboring pixels changes fast.
\item Thus, approximate the gradient of the intensity of each pixel.
\item Sobel showed that the gradient image $G_x$ of original image $A$ in x-dimension  can be approximated by:
$$G_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & +1 \\
-2 & 0 & +2 \\
-1 & 0 & +1 
\end{bmatrix} * A = S_x * A
$$
where $*$ indicates a mathematical operation known as a \textbf{convolution}, not a traditional matrix multiplication.
\item The filter matrix $S_x$ consists of the product of an \textbf{averaging} and a \textbf{differentiation} kernel: 
$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1   
\end{bmatrix}^{T}}_{averaging}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & +1   
\end{bmatrix}}_{differentiation}
$$
\end{itemize}
\framebreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Similarly, the gradient image $G_y$ in y-dimension can be approximated by:
        $$
            G_y = 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                -1 & -2 & -1  \\
                0 & 0 & 0 \\
                +1 & +2 & +1
            \end{bmatrix} * A = S_y * A
        $$
        \item The combination of both gradient images yields a dimension-independent gradient information $G$:
        $$
            G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}
        $$
        \item These matrix operations were used to create the filtered picture of Albert Einstein.

\begin{vbframe}{Why do we need to know all of that?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What we just did was extracting \textbf{pre-defined} features from our input (i.e. edges).
    \item A convolutional neural network does almost exactly the same: \enquote{extracting features from the input}.
    \item[] $\Rightarrow$ The main difference is that we usually do not tell the CNN what to look for (pre-define them), \textbf{the CNN decides itself}.
    \item In a nutshell:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We initialize a lot of random filters (like the Sobel but just random entries) and apply them to our input.
      \item Then, a classifier which is generally a feed forward neural net, uses them as input data.
      \item Filter entries will be adjusted by common gradient descent methods.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Working with images}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In order to understand the functionality of CNNs, we have to familiarize ourselves with some properties of images.
  \item Grey scale images:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Matrix with dimensions \textbf{h}eight $\times$ \textbf{w}idth $\times$ 1.
    \item Pixel entries differ from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Color images:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tensor with dimensions \textbf{h}eight $\times$ \textbf{w}idth $\times$ 3.
    \item The depth 3 denotes the RGB values (red - green - blue).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Filters:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A filter's depth is \textbf{always} equal to the input's depth!
    \item In practice, filters are usually square.
    \item Thus we only need one integer to define its size.
    \item For example, a filter of size $2$ applied on a color image actually has the dimensions $2 \times 2 \times 3$.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\only<5>{\item[] $s_{21} = d \cdot w_{11} + e \cdot w_{12} + g \cdot w_{21} + h \cdot w_{22}$}
\only<6>{\item[] And finally for $s_{22}$:}
\only<6>{\item[] $s_{22} = e \cdot w_{11} + f \cdot w_{12} + h \cdot w_{21} + i \cdot w_{22}$}
\only<7>{\item[] $s_{11} = a \cdot w_{11} + b \cdot w_{12} + d \cdot w_{21} + e \cdot w_{22}$}

\only<7>{\item[] $s_{22} = e \cdot w_{11} + f \cdot w_{12} + h \cdot w_{21} + i \cdot w_{22}$}
\only<8>{\item[] More generally, let $I$ be the matrix representing the input and $W$ be the filter/kernel. Then the entries of the output matrix are defined by $s_{ij} = \sum_{m,n} I_{i+m-1, j+n-1} w_{mn}$ where $m,n$ denote the image size and kernel size respectively.}
