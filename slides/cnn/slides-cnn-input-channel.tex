\frametitle{Input Channel}

\begin{vbframe}{Input Channel}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item An image consists of the smallest indivisible segments called pixels and every pixel has a strength often known as the pixel intensity. Whenever we study a digital image, it usually comes with three color channels, i.e. the Red-Green-Blue channels, popularly known as the RGB values. 
       \item In colored images, each pixel can be represented by a vector of three numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) for the three primary color channels: red, green, and blue.
       \item A grayscale image has a single input channel and value of each pixel represents only an amount of light; 
       \item Note a grayscale value can lie between 0 to 255, 0 signifies black and 255 signifies white. 
    \end{itemize}

In this CNN:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item there are 3 input channel, with the size of 4x4 as an input matrices, 
       \item one 2x2 filter (also known as kernel), 
       \item a single ReLu layer,
       \item a single pooling layer (which applies the MaxPool function),
       \item and a single fully connected (FC) layer.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
       \item The elements of the filter matrix are equivalent to the unit weights in a standard NN and will be updated during the backpropagation phase.
       \item Assuming a stride of 2 with no padding, the size of the convolution layer is determined by the following equation:
       \item $ O = \frac{I - K + 2.P}{S} + 1$ where: 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item O: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the new(convolution) square matrix, 
       \item I: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the input square matrix,
       \item K: is the dimension (rows and columns) of the filter (kernel) square matrix, 
       \item P: is the number of pixels(cells) of padding added,
       \item S: is the stride, or the number of cells skipped each time the kernel is slided.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \end{figure}

Putting these values in the equation,

\begin{align} 
O&={(4 - 2 + 2.0)\over 2} + 1\\ 
&=2 
\end{align}
