## Labs

 - Mix of theoretical and practical exercises
 - Not graded! Only final exam counts
 - Exercises posted on Moodle on Tuesday
 - Solutions on Friday
   - Only presented on popular demand
 - Lab sessions exist to discuss and ask questions
   - Attend not to fall behind the schedule
 - I will leave the Zoom call if nobody shows up in the first ten minutes

## Theory-oriented Exercises

 - Apply the math you see in the lectures
    - Pen-and-paper exercises on simple cases
    - Code the solution and test on simple problems
    - Brush up your linear algebra!
 - Purpose:
   1. Understand and internalize how things work
   2. Get practical experience in implementing ML algorithms
   3. Get ready for the exam

## Practice-oriented Exercises

 - Play with neural networks
   - github.com/jjallaire/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks
   - github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
 - Purpose:
   1. Learn to use a popular Deep Learning Framework
   2. Get a feeling for how neural networks behave
 - Handouts in R, Python is also accepted (and encouraged)

## Our software stack

 1. Keras for R
 2. Keras for Python
 3. Tensorflow (Python bindings)
 4. Tensorflow (C++)
      - CPU computations: BLAS (C/Fotran)
      - GPU computations: cuDNN (C)
      - TPU computations: Private Google library
